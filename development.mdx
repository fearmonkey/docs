## The basics

Often, consuming an API means that you're making RESTful requests to endpoints hosted by a public platform.

Here, your existing web server is the host. Your front end makes standard HTTP requests to the web server,  which processes them using request handlers provided by OwnId. 

It's those request handlers that provide the gateway for exchanging keys and data between your front end and your identity management services. 

Three endpoints support all the login and registration scenarios:

- Login

- register

- forgotPassword

Below are the major steps required to integrate with the API.
