Account Recovery automates the process of re-authenticating users who perhaps had an issue with their existing device.

<Note>
_If you haven't already, we recommend you build the user 'Login' journey first, as described [here](/building-blocks/build-login). Building login enables sufficient functionality to 'go live' and provides the code base you need to quickly implement 'Registration' and 'Password Recovery' when you're ready._  
</Note>

# Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, you should first add the three required event handlers on your web server as described in [Build Server Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints).

## Step 1 - Install OwnID Web SDK

The OwnID Web SDK provides communication between your frontend login page and the OwnID cloud server.

If you're using React or Angular frameworks, and you haven't yet installed the OwnID SDK on your local system, you should do that now before continuing.

Otherwise, continue to Step 2.

<Accordion title="Install the Own SDK">

To install the React-based or the Angular-based SDK use npm from the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React
npm install @ownid/react
```

```javascript Angular
npm install @ownid/angular
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>


## Step 2 - Reference the OwnID SDK

Reference the appropriate version of the OwnID SDK at the top of your web pages.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
<script>
    ((o,w,n,i,d)=>{o[i]=o[i]||(async(...a)=>((o[i].q=o[i].q||[]).push(a),{error:null,data:null})),
    (d=w.createElement("script")).src='https://cdn.ownid.com/sdk/'+n,d.async=1,w.head.appendChild(d)})  
    (window,document,'<appID>','ownid');
</script>
```

```jsx React
import { OwnIDInit } from '@ownid/react';
<OwnIDInit config={{appId:'9s8d7f9s87g98s7dgMyAppID'}}/>
```

```javascript Angular
import { OwnidAngularModule } from '@ownid/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    OwnidAngularModule.forRoot({appId:'s9d8f7s98f79s87dfMyAppID'}),
  ]})
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
**Maximize OwnID Benefits**

We recommend including the SDK on all pages, even those without user-facing authentication elements. Doing so will enable additional functionality.
</Note>

## Step 3 - Implement Account Recovery UX

Place the widget next to the password field by
inserting the script below.


<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript

</body>
```

```jsx React


```

```javascript Angular

```
</CodeGroup>

**That's it!** 

You've implemented the frontend functionality required for the user to recover their accounts.

Before going live make sure you check out the following the next steps!
