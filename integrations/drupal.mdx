OwnID supports integration with Drupal through our pre-built Drupal Connector.

Configuration on the Okta side happens through your Okta Admin Dashboard. Ensure you have an account with admin access in Okta.

## Installing The Module
To download and install the OwnID module, access the official [module page](https://www.drupal.org/project/ownid).

## Configuration Steps
An OwnID application connects your Drupal website with the OwnID button in the front end. To create an OwnID application:
1. Open the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com/) and create an account or log in to an existing account.
2. Create a **Drupal** integration and complete the onboarding.
3. Copy and paste the **appID** and **shared secret** into the settings of the OwnID Drupal module.
4. Enjoy your passwordless login! ðŸš€
