## How does it work?

OwnId lets you integrate your existing identity access management (<Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">IAM</Tooltip>) system with our platform to provide an automated, password-free login for your users and all the devices they use to access your site.

### Two ways to integrate: Connectors or API

We provide two distinct integration options:
1.  **Connectors** - Low-code/no-code integrations for specific <Tooltip tip="Identity and Access Management Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">IAM</Tooltip>s 
2.  **API/SDK** - OwnId's embeddable server-side endpoints and Web SDK for your front end  

Connectors are prebuilt integrations to selected IAMs. When a connector isn't available, the API provides an integration path as well as more flexibility, customization, and control for developers.
