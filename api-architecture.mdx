### How the API/SDK Works

Typically, consuming an API means making RESTful requests to endpoints hosted by a public platform.

Here, your existing web server hosts the endpoints. We provide code templates for each required event handler.
When a user logs in, your frontend generates a login event and upon receiving the event, the OwnID server makes the appropriate HTTP requests to _your_ web server, invoking request handlers provided by OwnID.

Those request handlers provide the gateway for exchanging keys and data between your frontend and your identity management services.
