title: 'One-Tap Sign-In'
description: 'Let existing users sign in with a single tap.'

Returning users need only tap the OwnID widget to log back in, no matter where they are on the site.
 
## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, make sure to do the following tasks first: 

1. Complete the backend integrations (see [Build Server-Side Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints)).
2. Complete the Login integration (see [Login](/building-blocks/build-login)).

<Note>
The instructions on this page assume you have already installed and referenced the OwnID SDK as described in Steps 1 and 2 of [Login](/building-blocks/build-login).

## Integrating One-tap Sign-in

Implement the event handlers, and OwnID integration on the desired page.

### Add the Widget to your Registration Form

The SDK **activateReturningUsersPrompt** method is used to integrate with the one-tap sign-in journey. It starts by offering users on the site the OwnId widget if they're not already logged in.  

#### Calling the SDK 

In JavaScript, OwnId SDK methods are instantiated by calling `owndId` with the appropriate method name and its parameters:
```Javascript
        ownid("method_name", {
            parameter_1: value_1,
            parameter_2: value_2,
            ...
            parameter_n: value_n,
            // Handle errors as you see fit
            onError: (error) => console.log(error),
            // When the relevant event fires,
            onSomeEvent: (ownIdData) => {ownIdDataObject = ownIdData;}
        });

  ```
In the example below, we're packaging all the parameters into a constant and passing it by reference through the **activateReturningUsersPrompt** method.

#### Implement the **activateReturningUsersPrompt** Method

In the ownId call:

1. Enter "activateReturningUsersPrompt" for the method name. 

2. Check to make sure the user isn't already logged in.
```Javascript Prompt only logged out users 
checkSession: async () => {
            /* only if `false` then the prompt will be shown */ 
            return this.authService.isLoggedIn();
```
3. Configure the `onLogin` event to instantiate the user session with `data.token` as shown.

4. Redirect the user to the appropriate landing page at your discretion.

5. Assign an error function as desired in the `onError` parameter.

Use the code snippets below, and check the embedded comments, to model your implementation of the submit handler and the SDK **activateReturningUsersPrompt** method.  

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript
<script>
    const config = {
        checkSession: async () => {
            /* only if `false` then the prompt will be shown */ 
            return this.authService.isLoggedIn();
        },
        onLogin: (data) => {
            //Generic example on how to set a session and redirect the user (use your own!)
            //1. set user session using data.token (usually a jwt or session token), generated in your backend and sent through the OwnID server
            this.authService.setAuth({ token: data.token });
            //2. redirect the user (this is just an example)
            this.router.navigateByUrl('/account');
        },
        onError: (errorMsg) => {console.log(errorMsg);}
    };
    ownid('activateReturningUsersPrompt', config);
</script>
```

**That's it!** 

You've implemented the frontend functionality required to allow registered users who aren't logged in to get a prompt to login with one tap from any page.

If you're ready to deploy your integration, make sure to read the [Pre-Deployment Checklist](/building-blocks/pre-deployment-checklist) before hand!
