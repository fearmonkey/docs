## How does it work?

OwnID provides frontend and backend components that allow you to integrate our services with your existing  <Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM, and identity and access management (IAM)."> identity platform</Tooltip> to enable automated, password-free login for your users and all the devices they use to access your site.

## Two ways to integrate: Connectors or SDK

You have two distinct integration options:
1.  **Connectors** - Low-code/no-code integrations for specific <Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM, and identity and access management (IAM).">identity platform</Tooltip>. 
2.  **SDK** - OwnID's Web SDK for your frontend.  

Our connectors are prebuilt, low-code integrations to selected identity providers. 

If a connector isn't available for your specific identity provider, the SDK provides an integration path with even greater flexibility, customization, and control.

Ready to get started with either option? Head over to the [Quickstart](/quickstart) page.
