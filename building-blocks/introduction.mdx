## Integration Overview

Three primary steps are required to implement OwnID journeys end-to-end. 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Preparation">
  [Set up your account](https://console.ownid.com/login), get your application id, and add a field to your user table to store OwnID data.      
  </Step>
  <Step title="Backend - Add Three Endpoints">
  Add the three event handlers that manage requests to each of three end-points made by the OwnID server when it receives login events from your frontend.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Frontend - Create User Journeys">
  Add our HTML JavaScript, templates, and the OwnID Password widget to build the login, registration, account recovery  workflow and install the OwnID Password widget.
  </Step> 
</Steps>

## Preparation

Before starting, create your account in the [developer console](https://console.ownid.com/login), register your base URL, and get your application id.

1. **Create your App**    
Login to the developer console and follow the instructions to create an app. You will also be asked to define the `base URL` that OwnID will use to make requests to your web server.  The console guides you through this process step by step.

<Info> If you want to start with local development, you can create a tunnel to your localhost server using a tool like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download). For example: `https://84c5df474.ngrok-free.dev/api/ownid` </Info>

2. **Get Integration Credentials**    
On your app page in the console, copy the following parameters needed for integration:

<Info>
- Your **application id** - _Use this also in data objects where specified by the_ `appId` _field._
- Your **shared secret** - _Use this to verify the signature in OwnID requests to your web server._
</Info>
3. **Create a VARCHAR field**    
Create a new character field called `ownIdData` in your user database. We'll use this field to store OwnID authentication data for registered users. 

<Info>
Be sure the `ownIdData` field meets the following requirements:

- A character datatype e.g., **VARCHAR**
- A minimum length of **5000 chars**
</Info>

## Next Step

Before building frontend user journeys, you must add three endpoints to your web server. 

<Card title="Add Request Handlers" icon="screwdriver-wrench" href="/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints">
OwnID provides templates for the three request handlers you'll host on your web server. These form the endpoints called with HTTP requests from the OwnID platform.
