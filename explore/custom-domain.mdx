You can use your own domain name during the OwnID flows (as for example when users scan a QR Code to sign-in). A custom domain lets you unify the login experience with your own brand and products.  

Your users see a URL that displays your brand such as `passwordless.your_domain.com` instead of passwordless.ownid.com.

## Select your subdomain

First, decide what subdomain to use:
If your domain is `example.com`, we recommend you use `passwordless.example.com` as your custom subdomain, but you can replace `passwordless` with whatever you like as long as it's a valid subdomain.

## Add your custom domain

After you decide on a subdomain, configure that for you App in the Console.

1. Log into the OwnID Console.
1. Click the _Custom Domain_ tab to start the domain connection process.
1. On the Custom Domain page, click **Set up your own** . The domain configuration form appears.
1. Enter your subdomain name. The DNS setup form opens.
1. Enter the subdomain in the form.
 
 You now see a form with an input to enter your desired subdomain. After entering your desired subdomain, a panel with instructions for setting up your DNS records will appear:

## Step 1: Create a DNS record

### Identify your DNS provider

Determine the service that's managing your DNS records, so you know exactly where to login and create the new records.

If you already know your DNS provider, you can move on to the next section. Often, it's the same place you registered your domain, but sometimes the DNS provider is different from your domain registrar.
<Info>
**NOTE** 
Frequently you domain provider is the same as your registrar, however that isn't always true. See the section below for additional tips.
</Info>

#### Finding your DNS Provider
In case you are not sure, you can use a [DNS Lookup](https://mxtoolbox.com/DnsLookup.aspx) tool and enter your domain. It might be able to tell you who your DNS provider is (but not always).

### Create required DNS records

These are standard instructions for creating your DNS records. If you have issues with any of the steps, please contact your DNS provider for more assistance:

#### Sign in to your DNS Provider

Most DNS providers have a control panel you can sign into to manage your DNS. Find your provider's control panel page and sign in.

#### Open your DNS Management UI

Now that you're logged in, navigate to  find where you can DNS management page. Typically the records for your domain are managed in your provider's _control panel_.

<Info>
**Can't find your Domain Management Page?**
Check for online help content or contact technical suuport for your DNS provider.
</Info>

**Create your CNAME record**

From your DNS _control panel_, add a new record that maps your desired subdomain to OwnID. 

DNS providers typically ask for the record type, name, value, and TTL or expiration date when you're creating a new record.

Enter the following values and save the new DNS record:

| Field                   | Instructions                                                                    | Description
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Type                    | Select **CNAME** from the dropdown | The kind of DNS record this is.           |
| Name                    | If your custom subdomain is passwordless.example.com, enter passwordless        | For CNAME records, this field is the first part of your subdomain (the part leading up to the first period). |
| Value                   | Copy the value from the OwnID console (example: ywdw3re63qefw.cnames.ownid.com) | This is what the new subdomain record points to–in this case, OwnID. Some providers may expect a trailing period (.) after the CNAME value. Make sure to verify that your CNAME value matches the format your provider expects. |
| TTL                     | Enter 300                                                                       | An expiration of 5 minutes (300 seconds) is okay. Your DNS provider might not allow you to change the TTL value. If this field is missing or you can’t change it, it’s safe to ignore this part of the configuration. |

### Verify your CNAME Record is Active

DNS information takes a few minutes to propogate across name servers.

Wait for 10 minutes after you complete your new CNAME record for your DNS provider to update its nameservers.

#### To Verify your New CNAME Record

1. Open the [MXtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/) Online Tool.
1. Enter your custom domain name in the Domain Name field.
1. Click MX Lookup to query for your CNAME record.
1. You should see canonical name that ends with `cnames.ownid.com` in the output. If you don't see that output at first, wait a few minutes and try the query again.
1. When you see that output, go to the next step in the OwnID Console and click **Verify**. 
1. A new panel with instructions for validating the ownership of your domain appears: 
<img src="/images/Custom_Domain_step2.png" width="600" alt="Custom Domain Step 2">
</img>

Your subdomain status is now in `Pending Validation` status until you prove the domain ownership. The next step is to validate domain ownership.

## Step 2: Validate the domain ownership

Create a new CNAME record to verify that you're the owner of this domain. This is required to issue TLS certificates for your domain.

Enter these values and save the new DNS record:

| Field                   | Instructions                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Type                    | Select **CNAME** from the dropdown | What kind of DNS record this is.           |
| Name                    | Copy the name from the OwnID console                                            | 
| Value                   | Copy the value from the OwnID console                                           | 
| TTL                     | Enter 300                                                                       | 

<Info>
**NOTE** The validation can take up to 72 hours, we will automatically refresh the status every 5 minutes.
</Info>

Once the validation is complete, the status of your domain will change to `Issued`.

## Removing your custom domain (Optional)

You can also remove an existing custom domain from here. If you do, it's important also to remove any DNS records you created for it.

#### To remove your custom domain

1. Go to the OwnID console > Custom Domain tab.
2. Click **Remove domain**.
3. Read the popup confirmation, and click **Disconnect** to confirm the removal.
4. Login to your DNS provider and delete the two DNS records you previously created for your custom subdomain.
