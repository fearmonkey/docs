By integrating your identity management system with the OwnId platform your web customers get frictionless access to your online products & services anywhere along their digital journey. 

## How does it work?
OwnId lets you integrate your existing identity access management (<Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">IAM</Tooltip>) system with our platform to provide an automated, password-free login for your users and all their devices.

### Two ways to integrate
We provide two distinct integration options:
1.  **Connectors** - Low-code/no-code integrations for specific <Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">IAM</Tooltip>s 
2.  **API/SDK** - OwnId's embeddable endpoints and Web Sdk  

Connectors are prebuilt integrations to selected IAMs. The API provides an integration path when a connector isn't available, as well as more flexibility and control for developers.
