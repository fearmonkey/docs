Login is the first frontend integration you should build. In addition to the login integration procedure, this page includes instructions for installing and referencing the SDK, which is a prerequisite for all other frontend integrations. 

## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, complete the backend integration first, as described in [Build Server-Side Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints).

## Integrating Login

Integrate login in just three steps. 
1. Step 1 - Install OwnID Web SDK
2. Step 2 - Reference the OwnID SDK
3. Step 3 - Add the Widget to your Login Form

### Step 1 - Install OwnID Web SDK

The OwnID Web SDK provides communication between your frontend login page and the OwnID cloud server.

If you're using React or Angular frameworks, and you haven't yet installed the OwnID SDK on your local system, you should do that now before continuing.

To install the React-based or the Angular-based SDK, select the tab that matches your framework and copy the npm command shown.

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React
npm install @ownid/react
```

```javascript Angular
npm install @ownid/angular
```
</CodeGroup>

### Step 2 - Reference the OwnID SDK

Reference the SDK at the top of your web pages.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
<script>
    ((o,w,n,i,d)=>{o[i]=o[i]||(async(...a)=>((o[i].q=o[i].q||[]).push(a),{error:null,data:null})),
    (d=w.createElement("script")).src='https://cdn.ownid.com/sdk/'+n,d.async=1,w.head.appendChild(d)})  
    (window,document,'<appID>','ownid');
</script>
```

```jsx React
import { OwnIDInit } from '@ownid/react';

//place this component on the top level of the component hierarchy
//this component doesn't render to any visible UI
ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
      <OwnIDInit
        config={{ appId: config.ownIdAppId }}
      />
      <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root"),
);
```

```javascript Angular
import { OwnidAngularModule } from '@ownid/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    OwnidAngularModule.forRoot({appId:'s9d8f7s98f79s87dfMyAppID'}),
  ]})
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
**Get the most from OwnID integration**

We recommend including the SDK on all pages, even those without user-facing authentication elements. Doing so will enable users to access additional functionality, wherever they are on your site.
</Note>

### Step 3 - Add the Widget to your Login Form

The SDK **login** method is used to integrate the login journey. It references the field Ids in your existing login form. It also renders the OwnId widget by automatically referencing your field elements (through their id) to calculate its position in the DOM.  

The sample login forms in the snippets below are vanilla examples, shown here only to confirm the implementation pattern of form fields in SDK methods. 

#### Calling the SDK 

In JavaScript, OwnId SDK methods are instantiated by calling `ownid` with the appropriate method name and its parameters:
```Javascript
        ownid("method_name", {
            parameter_1: value_1,
            parameter_2: value_2,
            ...
            parameter_n: value_n,
            // Handle errors as you see fit
            onError: (error) => console.log(error),
            // When the relevant event fires,
            onSomeEvent: (event) => console.log(event)
        });

  ```
We'll use the **login** method name here.

Check the Angular or React implementation example snippets for framework-specific variations of the syntax above.

#### Implement **login** Method

In the ownid method:

1. Enter "login" for the method name. 

2. Assign the form field (as a DOM element) you use as the password to the `passwordField` parameter.

3. Assign the form field (as a DOM element) you use as the login id to the `loginIdField` parameter.

4. Assign an error function as desired in the `onError` parameter.

5. Configure the `onLogin` event to copy the `data.token` object locally. The `data.token` is the value generated by the `getSessionByLoginId` endpoint and you should use it to set a user session or exchange it for a session token.

<Note>

**Session identifier can be ANY data Object**

Although we're calling it a 'token', the session identifier can be any unique data object. We only pass it right back to you so you're able to associate a callback with a session.
</Note>

Use the code snippets below, and check the embedded comments, to model your implementation of the submit handler and the SDK **login** method.  

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript
<body>
    <form name="myForm">
        <input id="email" type="text" name="email">
        <input id="password" type="text" name="password">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    <script>
        ownid("login", {
            loginIdField: document.getElementById("email"),
            passwordField: document.getElementById("password"),
            onError: (error) => console.log(error),
            onLogin: function (data) {
                // Generic example on how to set a session and redirect the user (use your own!)
                // 1. set user session using data.token (it can be any data object), generated in your backend and sent through the OwnID server, which does NOTHING with it except pass it back to you as appropriate!
                localStorage.setItem('sessionID', JSON.stringify({ token: data.token }));
                // 2. redirect the user to your preferred entry point 
                window.location.href = '/landingpage';
            }
        });
    </script>
</body>
```

```jsx React
import { OwnID, WidgetType } from '@ownid/react';

...

function LoginComponent() {
    const emailField = useRef(null);
    const passwordField = useRef(null);
    
    function onLogin(data) {
        //Generic example on how to set a session and redirect the user (use your own!)
        //1. set user session using data.token (usually a jwt or session token), generated in your backend and sent through the OwnID server
        localStorage.setItem('sessionID', JSON.stringify({ token: data.token }));
        //2. redirect the user (this is just an example)
        window.location.href = '/account';
    }
    return (
        <form>
            <input ref={emailField} type="email" name="email" />
            <input ref={passwordField} type="password" name="password" />
            <button type="submit">Log In</button>
            <OwnID type={WidgetType.Login}
                passwordField={passwordField}
                loginIdField={emailField}
                onError={(error) => console.error(error)}
                onLogin={onLogin} />
        </form>
    );
}
```

```javascript Angular
<form #myForm="ngForm" (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()">
  <input #emailField type="email">
  <input #passwordField type="password">
  <ownid [type]="WidgetType.Login"
       [loginIdField]="emailField"
       [passwordField]="passwordField"
       (onLogin)="onLogin($event)">
  </ownid>
  <button type="submit">Log In</button>
</form>

onLogin(data) {
  //Generic example on how to set a session and redirect the user (use your own!)
  //1. set user session using data.token (usually a jwt or session token), generated in your backend and sent through the OwnID server
  this.authService.setAuth({ token: data.token });
  //2. redirect the user (this is just an example)
  this.router.navigateByUrl('/account');
}
```
