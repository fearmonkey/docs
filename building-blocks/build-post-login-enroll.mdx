After a mobile user logs in to your site with a password, you can offer them enrollment in biometric verification at any time during their user journey.

## Calling Enrollment Endpoint

In your frontend code, after a user logs in successfully, call the _post-login enrollment_ endpoint to fetch the `authToken`.

```Javascript
var authToken = request(postLoginEnroll)
```

Call OwnID webSDK’s “enroll credential” function with this token.

```Javascript
await ownid.enrollCredential(loginId, authToken);
```
This triggers the “Enroll new credential” UX ONLY on mobile:
