Email templates let you customize email content to reflect your brand and personalize content for the customer.

## About Email Templates

The OwnID platform sends emails automatically when it needs to valiate users with either a <Tooltip tip="one-time passcode">OTP</Tooltip>
or a Magic Link.

### Templates for Each App
For each of your OwnID apps, you can create a unique email template to use when the system sends a _Magic Link_ email and another for _OTP_ emails. 

## Customize your Email Templates
