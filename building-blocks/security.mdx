## Validating Signatures

Requests from the OwnID server include two headers that can be used to ensure the request has not been tampered with. The first one, `ownid-signature`, is a hash value that the OwnID server generates from a timestamp and the body of the request. The second one, `ownid-timestamp` can be used by your backend to calculate the signature that is based on the timestamp and request body, and then compare the result to the value of `ownid-signature`. If both signatures do not match, the request has been altered.

Because the signatures are generated using an HMAC with the SHA256 hash function, the OwnID server and your backend must use the same cryptographic key when calculating the hash value. You can obtain this key from the OwnID Console, and then add the code generates a hash and compares it to the signature in your backend.

**Obtaining the HMAC Key**

Before the backend can generate the HMACSHA256 value, you must obtain the secret cryptographic key used in the calculation. Simply open your OwnID application in the [OwnID Console](https://console.ownid.com/) and copy the value from **MyApp > Shared Secret**.

**Request Verification**

Now that you have the cryptographic key, the backend can verify requests by generating each request's expected signature and compare it to the one generated by the OwnID server. The backend code must:

* **Step 1:** Extract the `ownid-signature` and `ownid-timestamp` headers from the request. These headers provide the HMAC code generated by the OwnID server and the timestamp it used to generate it.

* **Step 2:** Create the data string that will be used as an input to the hash function. To create it you need to concatenate:
    * The request body (in a JSON string format)
    * The character `.`
    * The timestamp (from the `ownid-timestamp` header)
* **Step 3:** Use HMAC with SHA256 to calculate a hashed value from the body-timestamp data string. The cryptographic key used in the calculation is the shared secret for your OwnID application.

* **Step 4:** Compare the hash value generated by your backend with the signature extracted from the `ownid-signature` header.

The following code snippets show how the backend might accomplish these steps:

<CodeGroup>

```javascript nodeJS
const crypto = require('crypto');

let key = "<your-shared-secret>"; // This is the shared secret from OwnID Console
let keyBuffer = Buffer.from(key, 'base64');
let body = JSON.stringify(req.body);
let ownIdSignature = req.headers['ownid-signature'];
let ownIdTimestamp = req.headers['ownid-timestamp'];
let dataToSign = `${body}.${ownIdTimestamp}`;

const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', keyBuffer);
hmac.update(dataToSign);
let signature = hmac.digest('base64');

if (signature !== ownIdSignature) {
   // The request has been tampered with
}
```

```python python
import hmac
import hashlib
import base64
import json

key = "<your-shared-secret>" # This is the shared secret from OwnID Console
key_buffer = base64.b64decode(key)
data = json.dumps(request.get_json(), separators=(',', ':'))
own_id_signature = request.headers.get('ownid-signature')
own_id_timestamp = request.headers.get('ownid-timestamp')
data_to_sign = f'{data}.{own_id_timestamp}'.encode(encoding='utf-8')
signature = hmac.new(key_buffer, data_to_sign, hashlib.sha256).digest()
signature = base64.b64encode(signature)
signature = signature.decode(encoding='utf-8')

if not signature == own_id_signature:
  # The request body or timestamp have been tampered with
```

```csharp csharp
using System.Security.Cryptography;

string key = "<your-shared-secret>"; // This is the shared secret from OwnID Console
Byte[] keyBuffer = Convert.FromBase64String(key);
var serializerOptions = new JsonSerializerOptions { Encoder = JavaScriptEncoder.UnsafeRelaxedJsonEscaping };
string body = JsonSerializer.Serialize(ownIdRequest.Content, serializerOptions);
string ownIdSignature = ownIdRequest.Headers.GetValues("OwnID-Signature").FirstOrDefault();
string ownIdTimestamp = ownIdRequest.Headers.GetValues("OwnID-Timestamp").FirstOrDefault();
string dataToSign = $"{body}.{ownIdTimestamp}";
Byte[] dataToSignBytes = Encoding.Default.GetBytes(dataToSign);

string signature;
using (HMACSHA256 hmac = new HMACSHA256(keyBuffer))
{
   signature = Convert.ToBase64String(
       hmac.ComputeHash(dataToSignBytes));
}

if (signature != ownIdSignature)
{
   // The request has been tampered with
}
```

```java java
import javax.crypto.Mac;
import javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec;
import javax.persistence.EntityNotFoundException;
import javax.persistence.NoResultException;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import java.security.Key;
import java.util.Base64;
import java.util.Map;

String key = "<your-shared-secret>"; // This is the shared secret from OwnID Console
byte[] keyBuffer = Base64.getDecoder().decode(key);
Key hashKey = new SecretKeySpec(keyBuffer, "HmacSHA256");
String ownIdSignature = headers.get("ownid-signature");
String ownIdTimestamp = headers.get("ownid-timestamp");
String dataToSign = String.format("%s.%s", bodyJson, ownIdTimestamp);
byte[] dataToSignBytes = dataToSign.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
Mac mac = Mac.getInstance("HmacSHA256");
mac.init(hashKey);
byte[] signatureBytes = mac.doFinal(dataToSignBytes);
String signature = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(signatureBytes);

if (!signature.contentEquals(ownIdSignature)) {
   // The request has been tampered with
}
```

## IP allowlisting

OwnID enforces IP allowlisting to make server-to-server calls to your servers. In order to allowlist OwnID calls, please consider the following IP addresses:
* 18.213.107.140
* 35.175.77.229

## Using Content-Security-Policy

When implementing [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) response headers in your site, you must be sure to include `*.ownid.com` in the rule definitions for specific policies for them to function properly.

An example rule set would look similar to the following:

```html
<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="script-src 'unsafe-eval' 'self' *.ownid.com;">
```
