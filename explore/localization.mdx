The OwnID interface uses American English (en_US) by default. If that’s fine, then you can skip this Localization page.

In order to configure your language(s), go to the `Branding → Button Look and Feel` page in the console. In the Language field, mark the checkboxes of all the languages in which your website interface can appear.

In case you have selected more than a language, you can specify which one will be active when the OwnID widget is initialized using the `language` parameter:

 ```javascript Example: Initializing OwnID in French
ownid('init', {appId: 'yourAppId', language: 'fr_FR'});
```
