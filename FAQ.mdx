## Integration FAQ

**Does OwnId persist any PII on its servers?**

_No, personal information about your customers or employees remains inside your firewall._

**How many API endpoints are required to integrate to OwnId?**

_Our API needs only three unique endpoints to expose full functionality of the OwnId system._

**Are there libraries or SDKs that must be employed as part of integration?**

_No. There’s no SDK required. OwnId lets you integrate with standard HTTP methods, and for some popular IMS platforms we provide turnkey, no-code/low-code connectors._

**Can we apply our branding look and feel to modals and pop ups?**

_Yes, our integration framework lets you customize colors, fonts, and images, to maintain a seamlessly branded user experience._

**We prefer to retain maximum control over our integrations. Do we have the option to use the API even when you have a connector for our IMS?**

_Absolutely. You can retain control over the entire integration or customize it extensively through our API._

**Can we use any development language to implement the API?**

_Absolutely. Any language that provides HTTP request functionality._ 

**How long does it take to implement one of the pre-configured OwnId Connectors?**

_Typical integration times are around one hour._

**If there’s no Connector available for the identity management system we use for our websites, how long does it typically take to use the API to integrate it?**

_Even with the API, much of the integration effort involves dropping code into your front-end and  back-end code. Typical integration times are one day!_

**What are all the other customization options that are available to us?**

**What if we need engineering help during our integration?**
