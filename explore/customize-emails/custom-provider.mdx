OwnID allows you to use your servers to integrate with your own email provider so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications.



## Build Server-Side Endpoint

This endpoint handles a request to send an OTP to a specific email address using your own email provider integration. 
Implement this endpoint according to the specifications: 

### Handle Requests

**Headers**

You might notice two values in request headers from the OwnID plaform:
 - `ownid-signature`  
 - `ownid-timestamp`

These are part of securing your integration.
To help ensure the integration and endpoints are secure, you must validate the signature of the requests as described in our [security page](/building-blocks/security).

**Payload**

OwnID will make requests to this endpoint with the following payload:
- `email` - delivery email address of the user.
- `subject` - email subject according to what is defined in the email templates.
- `body` - email body in HTML format, according to what is defined in the email templates. Includes the <Tooltip tip="one-time passcode">OTP</Tooltip>.

```json payload example
{
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "subject": "Login Verification",
    "body": "Your verification code is: 5928"
}
```

### Implement Responses
 
Implement these responses for your endpoint:

| Status | Description | Return |
|---------|--------- | ---------|
| `202` | Accepted | return empty body
| `401` | Invalid Signature Validation | return empty body
