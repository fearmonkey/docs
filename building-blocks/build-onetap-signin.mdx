Returning users can be automatically prompted for a single tap to log back in, no matter where they are on the site.
 
## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, make sure to do the following tasks first: 

1. Complete the backend integrations (see [Build Server-Side Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints)).
2. Complete the Login integration (see [Login](/building-blocks/build-login)). 

## Integrating One-Tap Sign In

<Note>
The instructions on this page assume you have already installed and referenced the OwnID SDK as described in Steps 1 and 2 of [Login](/building-blocks/build-login).
</Note>

## Integrating One-tap Sign-in

Implement the event handlers, and OwnID integration on the desired page.

### Add the Pop-Up Prompt to your Page

The SDK **activateReturningUsersPrompt** method is used to integrate with the one-tap sign-in journey. It starts by offering users on the site a pop-up to login by clicking the **Continue** button shown in Figure 1, if they're not already logged in.  

#### Implement the **activateReturningUsersPrompt** Method

In the `ownid` method:

1. Enter "activateReturningUsersPrompt" for the method name. 

2. Check to make sure the user isn't already logged in.

```Javascript Show prompt only to logged out users 
// only if `false` then the prompt will be shown 
checkSession: async () => { 
    // use your own method to check for if the user is logged in
    return this.authService.isLoggedIn(); 
}
```
3. Configure the `onLogin` event to copy the `data.token` object locally. The `data.token` is the value generated by the `getSessionByLoginId` endpoint and you should use it to set a user session or exchange it for a session token.

<Note>
**Session identifier can be ANY data Object**

As noted in the Login integration, the session identifier can be any unique data object, even though we're calling it a 'token'. We only pass it right back to you so you're able to associate a request with an active session.
</Note>

4. Redirect the user to the appropriate landing page at your discretion.

5. Assign an error function as desired in the `onError` parameter.

Use the code snippets below, and check the embedded comments, to model your implementation of the submit handler and the SDK **activateReturningUsersPrompt** method.

**That's it!** 

You've implemented the frontend functionality required to allow registered users who aren't logged in to get a prompt to login with one tap from any page.

If you're ready to deploy your integration, make sure to read the [Pre-Deployment Checklist](/building-blocks/pre-deployment-checklist) before hand!
