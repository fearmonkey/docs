## How does it work?

OwnID provides frontend and backend components that allow you to integrate our services with your existing  <Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM, and identity and access management (IAM)."> identity platform</Tooltip> to provide automated, password-free login for your users and all the devices they use to access your site.

### Two ways to integrate: Connectors or API

You have two distinct integration options:
1.  **Connectors** - Low-code/no-code integrations for specific <Tooltip tip="Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM, and identity and access management (IAM).">identity platform</Tooltip>. 
2.  **API/SDK** - OwnID's embeddable server-side endpoints and Web SDK for your front end.  

Our connectors are prebuilt, low-code integrations to selected IAMs. 

If a connector isn't available for your specific IAM, the API/SDK provides an integration path with even more flexibility, customization, and control.

Ready to get started with either option? Head over to the [Quickstart](/content/quickstart) page.
