Account Recovery automates the process of re-authenticating users who perhaps had an issue with their existing device.

<Note>
_If you haven't already, we recommend you build the user 'Login' journey first, as described [here](/building-blocks/build-login). Building login enables sufficient functionality to 'go live' and provides the code base you need to quickly implement 'Registration' and 'Password Recovery' when you're ready._  

</Note>
# Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, you should first add the three required event handlers on your web server as described in [Build Server Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints).

## Step 1 - Install OwnID Web SDK

The OwnID Web SDK provides communication between your frontend login page and the OwnID cloud server.

If you're using React or Angular frameworks, and you haven't yet installed the OwnID SDK on your local system, you should do that now before continuing.

Otherwise, continue to Step 2.

<Accordion title="Install the Own SDK">

To install the React-based or the Angular-based SDK use npm from the CLI:

<CodeGroup>
```javascript React
npm install @ownid/react
```

```javascript Angular
npm install @ownid/angular
```
</CodeGroup>
</Accordion>


## Step 2 - Reference the OwnID SDK

Reference the appropriate version of the OwnID SDK at the top of your web pages.

<CodeGroup>

```javascript JavaScript
<script>
    ((o,w,n,i,d)=>{o[i]=o[i]||(async(...a)=>((o[i].q=o[i].q||[]).push(a),{error:null,data:null})),
    (d=w.createElement("script")).src='https://cdn.ownid.com/sdk/'+n,d.async=1,w.head.appendChild(d)})  
    (window,document,'<appID>','ownid');
</script>
```

```jsx React
import { OwnIDInit } from '@ownid/react';
<OwnIDInit config={{appId:'9s8d7f9s87g98s7dgMyAppID'}}/>
```

```javascript Angular
import { OwnidAngularModule } from '@ownid/angular';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    OwnidAngularModule.forRoot({appId:'s9d8f7s98f79s87dfMyAppID'}),
  ]})
```
</CodeGroup>
<Note>
**Maximize OwnID Benefits**

We recommend including the SDK on all pages, even those without user-facing authentication elements. Doing so will enable additional functionality.
</Note>

## Step 3 - Implement Account Recovery UX

Place the widget next to the password field by
inserting the script below.


<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript

</body>
```

```jsx React


```

```javascript Angular

```
</CodeGroup>

<Check>
**That's it!** 

You've implemented the frontend functionality required for the user to recover their accounts.

Before going live make sure you check out the following the next steps!

OwnID-React SDK

A library for integrating OwnID into a React application.

Installation

Use the npm CLI to run:

npm install @ownid/react

Getting Started

    Initialize OwnID
    Add Register with OwnID to Your Application
    Add OwnID Login to Your Application

Initialize OwnID

Import OwnIDInit component to your App component and configure it with the appId of the website's OwnID application. To obtain the OwnID application's id, open the application in the OwnID Console.

...
import { OwnIDInit } from '@ownid/react';

...

  <OwnIDInit config={{ appId: '<your application id>' }}/>

Add Register with OwnID to Your Application

Add references to required elements

  const email = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const password = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const passwordConfirm = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

<input ref={email} type="email" name="email"/>
<input ref={password} type="password" name="password"/>
<input ref={passwordConfirm} type="password" name="password"/>

Add the OwnID component to the registration page.

<OwnID type={WidgetType.Register}
  loginIdField={email}
  passwordField={password}
  confirmPasswordContainer={passwordConfirm}
  onError={setError}
  onRegister={onRegister}
/>

Then add onRegister callback. Store ownIdData in your app storage. (global variable at window object just an example. It's not recommended using it in that way)

onRegister(ownIdData) {
  window.ownIdData = ownIdData;
}

To add OwnID to your application using a service instead of the HTML template, see Inject Service into Registration Component.
Modify Existing Registration Method

Now, wrap your existing registration logic within the getOwnIDData function. This function adds the OwnID payload to the form data before calling your existing registraion method.

onSubmit(formData) {
  if (window.ownIdData) {
    formData.ownIdData = btoa(JSON.stringify([window.ownIdData]));
  }
  
  //Call your existing registration logic in the backend
  return register(formData);
}

Add OwnID Login to Your Application

Add references to elements

  const email = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const password = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

    <input ref={email} type="email" name="email"/>
    <input ref={password} type="password" name="password"/>

Add the OwnID component to the login page.

    <OwnID type={WidgetType.Login}
      passwordField={password}
      loginIdField={email}
      onError={setError}
      onLogin={onLogin}
    />

To add OwnID to your application using a service instead of the HTML template, see Inject Service into Login Component.
Define onLogin Function

Now, define the onLogin function that is executed when the user logs in with OwnID. This function must set the user session and execute post-login actions like triggering an event or navigating to an authorized page. For example, the onLogin method might look like:

function onLogin(data: any) {
    //setting user session
    authService.setAuth({ token: data.token });
    
    //redirecting user to the account page
    navigateTo('/account');
  }

Alternative Integration Strategies

    Inject Service into Registration Component
    Inject Service into Login Component

Inject Service into Registration Component

As an alternative to incorporating the OwnID component into an HTML template, use the ownidReactService service at the registration page:

const email = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
const password = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
const passwordConfirm = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

useEffect(() => ownidReactService.register({
  loginIdField: email.current,
  passwordField: password.current,
  confirmPasswordContainer: passwordConfirm.current,
  onRegister: (ownidData) => onRegister(ownidData),
  onError: (error: string) => setError(error),
}), []);

Now, you need to modify your existing registration method.
Inject Service into Login Component

As an alternative to incorporating the OwnID component into an HTML template, use the ownidReactService service at the login page:

  const email = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  const password = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);
  
  useEffect(() => ownidReactService.login({
    loginIdField: email.current,
    passwordField: password.current,
    onLogin: (ownidData) => onLogin(ownidData),
    onError: (error: string) => setError(error),
  }), []);

Now, you need to define the onLogin function.
Integrate the OwnID SDK in your registration pages.
