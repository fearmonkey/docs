By integrating with the OwnId platform your web customers get frictionless access to your online products & services anywhere along their digital journey. 

## How does it work?
OwnId lets you integrate your existing identity access management (IAM) system with our platform to provide an automated, password-free login process for your users and any of their devices.

### Two ways to integrate
OwnId provides two distinct integration options:
1.  Low-code/no-code Connectors
2.  OwnId API 

Connectors are prebuilt integrations to selected IAMs. The API provides an integration path when a connector isn't available, as well as more flexibility and control for developers.
