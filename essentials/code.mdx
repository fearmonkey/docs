## The basics

Often, consuming an API means that you're making RESTful requests to endpoints hosted by a public platform.

Here, your existing web server is the host. Your front end makes HTTP requests to the web server using request handlers provided by OwnId. Those request handlers provide a gateway for exchanging keys and data between your front end and your identity management services throughout the authentication and enrollment processes.

### Inline Code

To denote a `word` or `phrase` as code, enclose it in backticks (`).

### Code Block

Use [fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) by enclosing code in three backticks and follow the leading ticks with the programming language of your snippet to get syntax highlighting. Optionally, you can also write the name of your code after the programming language.

```java HelloWorld.java
class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
