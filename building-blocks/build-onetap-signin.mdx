Returning users need only tap the OwnID widget to log back in, no matter where they are on the site.
 
## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, make sure to do the following tasks first: 

1. Complete the backend integrations (see [Build Server-Side Endpoints](/building-blocks/build-server-endpoints)).
2. Complete the Login integration (see [Login](/building-blocks/build-login)). 

## Integrating One-Tap Sign In

<Note>
The instructions on this page assume you have already installed and referenced the OwnID SDK as described in Steps 1 and 2 of [Login](/building-blocks/build-login).
</Note>

### Triggering the Returning Users Experience

Place the widget next to the password field by
inserting the script below.

The `data.token` is the value generated by the `getSessionByLoginId` endpoint and you should use it to set a user session or exchange it for a session token. 

<CodeGroup>

```javascript Javascript
<script>
    const config = {
        checkSession: async () => {
            /* only if `false` then the prompt will be shown */ 
            return this.authService.isLoggedIn();
        },
        onLogin: (data) => {
            //Generic example on how to set a session and redirect the user (use your own!)
            //1. set user session using data.token (usually a jwt or session token), generated in your backend and sent through the OwnID server
            this.authService.setAuth({ token: data.token });
            //2. redirect the user (this is just an example)
            this.router.navigateByUrl('/account');
        },
        onError: (errorMsg) => {console.log(errorMsg);}
    };
    ownid('activateReturningUsersPrompt', config);
</script>
```
</CodeGroup>

**That's it!** 

You've implemented the frontend functionality required to allow registered users to login with one tap from any page.
