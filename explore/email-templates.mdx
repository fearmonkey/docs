Email templates let you customize email content to reflect your brand and personalize content for the customer.

Emails are sent in use cases where OwnID needs to send either a <Tooltip tip="one-time passcode">OTP</Tooltip>
or a Magic Link to a user.

You can create a unique email template for each of your OwnID apps, and for each type of email -- Magic Link or OTP. 

## Customize your Email Template

1. Log into the [Console](https://console.ownid.com/home) and select the App that you want to associate with your template. The My App view opens.

1. Click the **Branding** menu from the left side navigation panel.

1. Select **Email templates** from the dropdown menu. The _Email templates_ page opens.

1. From _Select a template_ select _Magic link_ or _Verification Email (using code)_.


1. The existing template appears.
