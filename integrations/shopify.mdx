OwnID supports integration with Shopify through our pre-built Shopify Connector.

Configuration on the Shopify side happens through the OwnID Connector in the Shopify marketplace. Ensure you have an account with admin access in Shopify. 

## Step 1 - Enable Multipass

Log in to your shop admin and go to the **Settings > Checkout and accounts** page. Scroll down to the **Customer accounts section** section and ensure that you have "Allow customers to log in from online store and checkout" selected.

Select **Enable Multipass**. Once enabled, a secret will be shared with you. You need the secret during the OwnID onboarding. Make sure you keep your secret private.

## Step 2 - Get your Shopify API Access Token

In order to use our Shopify integration you will need the URL of your Shopify Store and an API access token. In this section you will learn how to generate and find this API access token within your Shopify Store.

You can enable a custom app from your Shopify owner's account. To do this:

1. Log in to your Shopify Store as the store owner.
1. Select **Apps** in the admin section on the left sidebar.

7. Under **Admin API access scopes** you'll see many categories. Scroll down until you reach **Customers**, or search for Customers in the search bar. Here, you'll click to tick the boxes for 'write_customers' and 'read_customers', then click the **Save** button.

8. Go to the **API Credentials** and click on **Install** in the Access tokens box.
Now you will see your Admin API Access Token has been generated. Click on **Reveal token once** and you will see the token. You will use this access token during the onboarding in the OwnID console.

## Step 3 - Create OwnID Application

Each website integrating with OwnID must have an OwnID application.

4. Complete the integration steps. Use your `Shopify Multipass secret` and `Shopify API Access Token` described above.

## Step 4 - Add OwnID button

Lastly, we'll add the passwordless button to the login and registration forms.

To complete this step, you'll need to edit three pages of your Shopify theme:

1. From your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Themes**.
2. Click **Actions > Edit code**. The code editor shows a directory of theme files on the left, and a space to view and edit the files on the right.
3. On the left panel, go to the folder **Layout** and select the file **theme.liquid**. Place the following script in the `<head>` of the file:

```js
<script>
((o,w,n,i,d)=>{o[i]=o[i]||(async(...a)=>((o[i].q=o[i].q||[]).push(a),{error:null,data:null})),
(d=w.createElement("script")).src='https://cdn.ownid.com/sdk/'+n,d.async=1,w.head.appendChild(d)})  
(window,document,'<appID>','ownid');
       ownid('init', {boxShadow:'none'});
</script>
```

4. Now, go to the folder **Sections** and select the file **main-login.liquid**. Place the following code **after** your login form:

```js
  <script>
       ownid("login", {
            mobileInfoTooltipPosition:'end',
            loginIdField: document.getElementsByName("customer[email]")[0],
            passwordField: document.getElementsByName("customer[password]")[0],
            targetField: document.getElementsByName("customer[password]")[0].parentElement,
            onError: (error) => console.log(error),
            onLogin: function (data) {
                //setting user session
                window.location.href = data.token;
            }
        });
  </script>
```

5. Finally, inside the same folder **Sections**, select the file **main-register.liquid**. 

Add the following input after your password field element, inside the registration form:

```html
  <div class="ownIdData">
      <input id="ownIdData" type="hidden" name="customer[note][ownIdData]" />
  </div>
```

In the same file, place the following code after the registration form:

```js
  <script>
      ownid("register", {
            loginIdField: document.getElementById("RegisterForm-email"),
            passwordField: document.getElementsByName("customer[password]")[0],
            targetField: document.getElementsByName("customer[password]")[0].parentElement,
            onError: (error) => console.log(error),
            onRegister: function (data) {
                document.getElementById("ownIdData").value = "<ownIdData>" + data.data + "</ownIdData>";
            }
        });
  </script>
```

5. Save your changes.
