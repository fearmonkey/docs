## How does it work?

OwnID provides frontend and backend components that allow you to integrate our services with your existing identity access management (<Tooltip tip="Identity and Access Management. Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">IAM</Tooltip>) system to provide automated, password-free login for your users and all the devices they use to access your site.

### Two ways to integrate: Connectors or API/SDK

You have two distinct integration options:
1.  **Connectors** - Low-code/no-code integrations for specific <Tooltip tip="Identity and Access Management Synonymous with Id management systems, IdM.">identity platforms</Tooltip> 
2.  **API/SDK** - OwnID's embeddable server-side endpoints and Web SDK for your front end  

Our connectors are prebuilt, low-code integrations to selected platforms. 

If a connector isn't available for your specific identity platform, the API/SDK provides an integration path with even more flexibility, customization, and control.

### API/SDK integration basics

Typically, consuming an API means making RESTful requests to endpoints hosted by a public platform.

Here, your existing web server hosts the endpoints. We provide code templates for each required event handler.

When a user logs in, your frontend generates a login event and upon receiving the event, the OwnID server makes the appropriate HTTP requests to _your_ web server, invoking request handlers provided by OwnID. 

Those request handlers provide the gateway for exchanging keys and data between your frontend and your identity management services.
